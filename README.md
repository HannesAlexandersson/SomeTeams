WU23 assignment under PHP education
###start of the project
started the project off by using the newly aquired tool of notion.so to plan out the project. 
So today the 27/9 I began by inputting all of  the requirements in notion. I planned out the steppes I needed to take to complete the project and a rough time estimate. 

I mapped out how I would build the project, what files would I need etc. 
I made the index file, downloaded the data file, and made a testphp file for testrunning solutions before implanting it to the "real" php files. 

I began to do basic research:

roadmap: build the external files
        - the file holding the data
        - the file building the table
        - the files that was required to do certain things

        when I have all the different components, start building the actuall website, 
            - start in simple html and css and make a layout. 

Problems: 
The first problem I ran into was when building the structures for a html table with the data from the provided array. I was trying to make an foreach loop to loop the array, but in some cases there was no data, or it was null rather. So i figured I needed an If statement in the loop, but the program wouldnt let me. I spent hours trying to find answers to this problem and it turned out it was a simple syntax error! in other words my logic was correct but my syntax knowledge was lacking!
