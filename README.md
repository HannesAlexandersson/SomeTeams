WU23 assignment under PHP education
###start of the project
started the project off by using the newly aquired tool of notion.so to plan out the project. 
So today the 27/9 I began by inputting all of  the requirements in notion. I planned out the steppes I needed to take to complete the project and a rough time estimate. 

I mapped out how I would build the project, what files would I need etc. 
I made the index file, downloaded the data file, and made a testphp file for testrunning solutions before implanting it to the "real" php files. 

I began to do basic research:

roadmap: build the external files
        - the file holding the data
        - the file building the table
        - the files that was required to do certain things

when I have all the different components, start building the actuall website, 
            - start in simple html and css and make a layout. 
## WorkFlow:

After I have done all the basic research that I needed I started my work by building all the necessery parts of the project that I needed. I began by creating a repo at github. Then I went ahead and made the 3 key component of the webpage (head, main, footer) and a index file that would require the different parts. 

Then I made the different parts that was an requirement of the project I.E the table and the other files. After that was done I took and old fashioned pen and paper and started to skiss out the layout of the page. This helped me understand how to build tha html elements. I knew from the start for example what needed to be flex display and what needed to be flex-item etc. 

After that I started building the actual website. First I made an rough basic page. I deployed it to my domain. And as the days passed by I contiunued to work on the page and implanted all the different content of the page. 

I opted for an design that first displayed all the differnt teams of the array with links. Then on the nav-bar I linked the table and the other files. 

For design: As the assignment wa about football teams I went for an design that took the colour scheme of my own personal favourite football teams colours and used them as background and highlighting colors. 

for the layout I opted for an basic flex-card solution. 


## Problems: 
The first problem I ran into was when building the structures for a html table with the data from the provided array. I was trying to make an foreach loop to loop the array, but in some cases there was no data, or it was null rather. So i figured I needed an If statement in the loop, but the program wouldnt let me. I spent hours trying to find answers to this problem and it turned out it was a simple syntax error! in other words my logic was correct but my syntax knowledge was lacking!

Second problem: I couldnt get the flexbox to behave as I wished. in the end i got it to work, but it didnt end up as my original skissed had mapped it out to be. It seems to me that now i might have a flex container or two too much then I perhaps need. But the css is at this stage I bit overhelming so Im scared to dive in to it to try and sort it out so I better keep it at it is for the moment and instead take this lesson to heart and remembe it in the future for stuff not to do!
